##  relational operator--

# SELECT WITH CONDITION--

## SHOW 1 EMPLOYEE DATA--
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE  ENAME='SHUBHAM'; # IT SHOWS THE ROWS WHERE ENAME IS SHUBHAM

# SHOW DEPARTMENT WISE DATA--
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE EDEPARTMENT='COMPUTER'; # IT SHOWS THE ROWS WHERE EDEPT IS COMPUTER


SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE EID=4;  #  Returns the row where employee ID is exactly 4
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE EID!=4; #  Returns all rows where employee ID is NOT 4
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE ESALARY> 60000; # Returns all employees earning more than 60,000
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE ESALARY< 60000; # Returns all employees earning less than 60,000
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE ESALARY >=50000; # Returns all employees earning 50,000 or more
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE ESALARY <=50000; # Returns all employees earning 50,000 or less

# BETWEEN OPERATOR--

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE ESALARY BETWEEN 60000 AND 80000; # it shows the record where esalary is between 60000 80000 including 60000 and 80000
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE EID BETWEEN 2 AND 5; # it shows the employees whose eid is between 2 and 5 including 2 and 5
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE ENAME BETWEEN 'A' AND 'S'; # it shows the employees whose ename is between A and S(in alphabetical order) including A and S

select * from employee;

## In clause--

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE EDEPARTMENT IN('IT' , 'COMPUTER'); # it shows all employees who are in IT or computer department
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE EID IN(1,3,5,7); # it shows all employees whos eid is 1,3,5,7


## Like operators-- 

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE ENAME LIKE 'A%'; # shows all employee record where ename starts with A
# % -it matches any no of character incuding none

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE ENAME LIKE 'AN%'; # shows all employee record where ename start with AN
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE ENAME LIKE '%I'; # shows all emplyoee record where ename end with I
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE ENAME LIKE '%R__'; # its shows record End with exactly 3 characters and the last 3 characters end with R followed by two more characters
/*
Breakdown:

1) % matches any number of characters before the last 3.

2)'R' must be at the third-to-last position.

3)__ matches exactly two characters.*/

### SO THE ACTUAL LOGIC IS ITEREPTED AS
